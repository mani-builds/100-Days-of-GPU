* Day 1
Completed Chapter 1 of PPMP4
- Understood the different compliers used by host and device to run their respective part of the code in a CUDA C
- NVCC complier does the seperation of host and device code to do the above based on '__host__' and '__device__' tags

* Day 2 
Completed all the exercises in Chapter 1 of PPMP4

* Day 3 
Correction: Last chapter was Chapter 2 
Started Ch3, read about multidimensional grids and blocks. Grids and blocks are 3-D and are odered from highest dimensionality to lowest i.e (gridDim.z, gridDim.y, gridDim.z)

* Day 4 
Started reading on mapping data to multidimensional threads

* Day 5 
Cuda code for dynamic multidimensional threads (Ch 3)
